    "knn certainly functions better in this case, as I would expect it to. The r-squared is higher and the variance is lower on the knn model. Seeing how the knn model is tailored around each group of points vs. ols's generalized line, I would expect knn to almost always function better. It is slower, which makes it less valuable for large datasets that have a strong linear relationship between the features and the target. I could also see the knn model suffering from overfitting easily. In that case, it may be better to go for a larger number of neighbors when the data is erratic. In general, however, knn seems to be the way to go."
